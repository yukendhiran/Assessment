# Assessment

I used TailwindCSS and Next.js to build a pixel-perfect replica of the design provided to me. 
However, I acknowledge that the website is currently optimized for the resolution of 1440x1024 used in the design. 
To view the website, please open developer tools (ctrl+shift+i) and set the resolution to 1440x1024.

The project is located in the login_page directory, and both the sign-in and dashboard pages are fully functional. 
If you encounter any issues while redirecting from the sign-in page to the dashboard, 
you can access the dashboard page directly in the dashboard_page directory of the repository.
